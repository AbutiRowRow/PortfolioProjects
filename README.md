# PortfolioProjects
This repository consists of my marquee projects made for data analysis in SQL and Python

The 4 python projects aim to tackle 3 main functions used in data analysis processing. The demographic data analyzer used python's mathematical and dataframe libraries to process the data to it's reqiured state for exploration purposes. Medical data visualiser as well Time series visualiser uses python's seaborn library to create even more insightful data visualsations should it be reqiured and the sea level predictor uses python's statistical libraries to predict the sea level based on extrapolating the past to create a linear regression which can model a predicitve estimation of the sea level.

The SQL projects are aimed to tackle the databasing and uncovering relationships by means. The company database aimed to show how to organize a company database as well as the linking multiple tables to uncover insghts by effecient filtering using queries which are easy to follow. The Covid databased used exisitng covid data to analyse the Covid-19 impact across African countries, the excel spreadsheet was cleaned by simple operations such as filtering and sorting then exported as a csv file then to a json file to complete operations through a MySQL workbench.
